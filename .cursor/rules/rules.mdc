When generating code, please follow these principles:

1.  **Code Readability**
    *   Write clean, well-structured code
    *   Use meaningful variable and function names

2.  **Documentation**
    *   Comments must be:
        *   Added only when necessary
        *   Used to explain **"why," not "what."** Good code is self-documenting and explains what it does. Comments should be reserved for explaining design decisions or complex logic.
        *   **Avoid clutter.** Do not write obvious comments, such as `i++ // Increment i by 1`.

3.  **Development Process**
    *   First think through the problem before writing code
    *   Consider the first principles and fundamental requirements
    *   Plan the structure and architecture beforehand
    *   Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts

4.  **Best Practices**
    *   Follow language-specific conventions and style guides
    *   Implement error handling where appropriate
    *   Write maintainable and scalable code
    *   Consider performance implications
